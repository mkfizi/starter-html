# Starter HTML
Starter kit for HTML and TailwindCSS projects.

## Usage
This barebone starter kit serves as starting point when developing web applications or sites. It eliminates the need for base configuration for HTML and Tailwind. By default, this project is utilizing [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for source code bundling but can be switch to any bundling tools.

## Installation
Clone this repository to get started.

Run the following command in project directory to install TailwindCSS dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

Run one of the following commands to execute, build or preview site using Vite server:
```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Vite Configuration

Vite has been preconfigured in `vite.config.ts` to optimize the development workflow for AlpineJS and TailwindCSS projects:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    root: './src',
    publicDir: '../public',
    build: {
        outDir: '../dist',
        emptyOutDir: true,
        rollupOptions: {
            input: glob.sync(resolve(__dirname, 'src/**/*.html'))
        }
    },
    plugins: [
        tailwindcss(),
    ],
})
```

- `root: './src'` — Specifies that your source content (HTML, JS, CSS) is inside `src/`.
- `publicDir: '../public'` — Points to the `../public` directory for static assets that should be built as-is.
- `build.outDir: '../dist'` — Specifies the output directory `../dist` for production build.
- `build.emptyOutDir: true` — utomatically cleans the output directory before each build
- `rollupOptions.input: glob.sync(resolve(__dirname, 'src/**/*.html'))` — Dynamically pick up all .html files in src/ as entry points (helpful for multi-page sites).
- `plugins: [ tailwindcss() ]` — Includes TailwindCSS plugin for processing utility classes during development and production build.

This configuration supports multi webpages by dynamically build all HTML files in `src/` into `dist/` and ensures proper asset handling in `public/`.
